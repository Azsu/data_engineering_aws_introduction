### AWS-CloudFormation

1. Introduction: 
1. Purpose: It's important to create your cloud resources from code for many reasons, and although it adds some complexity for beginers here, it also adds a level of financial protection to your account by providing you the ability to scale down all your resources from a single location while also keeping track of all systems you have created.
  1. Alternative: https://www.terraform.io/
  1. Comparison: https://www.missioncloud.com/blog/aws-cloudformation-vs-terraform-which-one-should-you-choose
  1. Note: I recommend students review Terraform as an alternative to CloudFormation as it is an important knowledge domain when applying for work positions.
